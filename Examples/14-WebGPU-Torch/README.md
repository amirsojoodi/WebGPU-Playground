# WebGPU Torch Benchmark

This example is a slightly changed version of the benchmark available at [WebGPU-Torch](https://github.com/praeclarum/webgpu-torch/).

The `torch.js` available in the current directory is built directly from the repo:

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/praeclarum/webgpu-torch.git)
2. Let webpack generate `torch.js` by `npm run build`

Alternatively, you can install it using:

1. `npm i webgpu-torch`, or
2. Add it as a dependency to your webpage by `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webgpu-torch@latest/torch.js"></script>`

For more info, check out its [docs](https://praeclarum.org/webgpu-torch/docs/).
